## Getting Started

First, install dependencies by running this command in a terminal inside the my-app directory:
```bash
npm install
```
_Note: You'll need to have npm and Node installed for this to work._

Next, run the back-end file:
```bash
python ../back-end/app.py
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
