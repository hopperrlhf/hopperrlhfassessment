## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:
```bash
npm run install
```
Note: You'll need to have npm and Node installed for this to work.

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Finally, run the back-end file:
```bash
python ../back-end/app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
